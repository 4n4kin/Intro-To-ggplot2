Introduction to ggplot2 & ggvis in R
====================================

This Repository is my attempt at creating a *how to* manual for `ggplot2` basics in `R` . Later on, I'll add `ggvis`(*definitely*) & `lattice`(*maybe*) basics too as I delve deeper into plotting & data representation in R.

I'll try to move forward in *plot-focused* path for this tutorial.
